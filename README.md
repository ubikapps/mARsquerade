Google Cardboard Augmented Reality Face Detecting Android app

Uses device camera to drive Google CardboardView. Uses Google Play Services Vision API to detect faces and overlays happy or sad mask onto smiley/frowney faces.

Requires a Google Cardboard and a slightly warped mind.

WARNING: device may get hot when running this app. I am not responsible for your Google Cardboard or face catching fire.

Android devices that support a decent square preview size like the Nexus 5X will get a distorted camera preview.
